    <p1>
        The purpose of this project was to compare various <br>
        weather conditions in a variety of cities around the world. <br>
        Several aspects of the weather, such as wind speed, cloudiness, <br>
        and temperature, were compared based on the latitude of each city.
    </p1>

    <p2>
        The data was analyzed through Python using both the Pandas <br>
        and Matplotlib libraries.  Statistics were also calculated <br>
        to draw conclusions for each comparison.
